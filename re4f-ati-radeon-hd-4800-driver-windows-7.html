                            <p>Еще когда проверял с помощью программы совместимости, узнал, что Win7 не совместима с видеокартой ATI RADEON HD 3850 521mb. Ved 09.12.2010. Перед тем как прошивать карту, хочу спросить. У меня стоит 2-е карты ATI 4850 512 мб и Asus 4850 1 гиг в режиме CrossFireX. 
Hey guys I've got a ATI Radeon HD 4800. I've had it running on my Windows 10 for at least 4 months now. Ever since last week, it started crashing whenever I start up a game. Movies and everything else continues to work fine. It crashes even when I start a 3DMark test run. I've reset windows completely in an attempt to reset the driver, but the problem continues. Any help would be great. The details from gpu-z Vendor: Sapphire BIOS Version: 011.022.000.004.033025 Driver Version: 8.970.100.9001. Game will not launch past the "PLAY" splash screen. Once I click play, the screen goes black as if the game is about to start then it gives me the XCOM has stopped working error followed by a steam error code 41? Not sure if it's all server based or something. Doubtful. I reinstalled the game twice and verified the cache as well. All my gpu drivers are up to date as are any other drivers, and there aren't anymore updates available. I understand I'm not the only one having this issue but it seems. Hi Tech Support, My computer was built in 2009 and has a ATI Radeon HD 4800 Series graphics card. I've been getting some broken graphics and vertical bars appear on my screen, followed by some black screens flashing, and when the picture returns, there's an error message stating "Display driver stopped responding and has recovered. Display driver ATI Radeon Family stopped responding and successfully recovered." This happens after 20-30 minutes of computer usage, and 1-5 minutes after 
I am running Windows 10 Pro, with a i7-2600K @3.40 GHz, 8 GB of RAM, and an ATI Radeon HD 4800 series graphics card. I've updated the graphics card driver to what I believe is the most current version (8.970.100.9001). However, when I try to play a specific game (BF4), I get an error which says that my driver is version 13.4 and that it is recommended i have version 13.12 or later and to update my driver. It gives me an option to try and run the game anyway, which simply gives I made a post on here a while ago but wasn't able to follow up with my system information. I bought Dark Souls 2 a while ago and was sad to see it didn't start, whenever I click play in Steam it just white screens immediately and just says that it has stopped working. System Specs: Processor: AMD FX(TM)-4300 Quad-Core Processor 3.80 GHz. Ram: 8GB. System Type: 64-bit operating system running on windows 8.1. Graphics Card: ATI Radeon HD 4800 Series. I have tried updating my drivers Hi guys, im a longtime Dota player, but i just recently got a cheap PC from a friend for 20€. He told me i can try if Dota 2 works on it. This are the specs: ASUS P5W DH Deluxe Intel Core 2 Duo E7200 (i think 2 of those? Says in the hardware manager) Ati Radeon HD 4800 Series 4GB Ram and a Samsung HD. My friend is a gamer, and he said Diablo3 etc worked on max settings. But im just not sure atm. I just set up the PC and installed a fresh Windwos 7. The system itself is not really "quick" 
So i have a ATI Radeon HD 4800 Series video card, and it keeps failing and the driver has to keep resetting. When i upgraded to windows 10 it was better for about a week then started happening again. The screen will go black, then come back on with bars everywhere or just completely fucked up. At first I thought it was an error with the driver, but after reinstalling multiple times using different drivers I'm starting to think it's just the video card dying. (I bought this comp used about  So last night my dual monitors worked fine. (ACER H213H and an LG HDTV) Today seems to be a different case. This has happened before, but a simple reset used to fix it. I use a DVI cable for the H213H and an HDMI for the TV. The TV's settings are telling me the cable is detected, unlike the computer. I've tried reinstalling drivers, fixing the resolution under the Control Panel (the HDTV is no longer listed here), resetting, unplugging everything, testing different cables and using other device. Hey, I wanted to see if anyone could help or share information about this kind of crash: My game will freeze, go to black screen, then windows will give me the message that my graphics driver has crashed and recovered. Usually by the time it recovers the gods have disconnected me. Sometimes it doesn't recover and my whole pc freezes. Graphics quility settings make no difference. Windowed or fullscreen makes no difference. I'm running two ati radeon hd 4800 (crossfire) with up to date drivers. 
I bought a pc from a friend and knew it wasn't working all the way, the motherboard wasn't accepting graphics cards and the graphics card was dead . The hard drive was corrupted as well . This computer has a i7-2600k with 12 gb of ram and is watercooled. Now I replaced the motherboard which is working and fixed the hard drive to run Windows 7 no problem . Well here's the problem . It's running very slow for an i7-2600k 3.40ghz base clock and the country temp is 90^ Celsius I don't So i updated to Windows 8.1 62bit a few months ago. I did a completely new install. Wiped both of my hard drives and started from scratch. Today i decided i wanted to play minecraft again and had to install it again. I installed the latest launcher, latest java, and updated my video card drivers. The problem is it is throwing me an error saying my video card drivers need updating. "Pixel format not accelerated" Even though i had already updated them, i followed the update links they provide. Hello /r/MassEffect, I come to you with a problem I have encountered trying to play Mass Effect 1 again. I've never encountered this problem before and have been doing some research on it. It's not an uncommon problem I've discovered but all the methods I have read for treating it have failed me. I've only just become a Spectre and I'm trying to board the Normandy. As soon as I activate the door panel so the ship can scan me and the screen fade to black to load on-board the Normandy I startup the game and get a white screen with the error message "Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin has stopped working" and I have to close the program, I've tried all the 10 things listed on the steam support page and none of them have worked, please help!

Hey guys, A friend of mine upgraded his computer recently and I got my hands on his old box. I'm wondering what all I can do to upgrade it because it's a computer he bought back in 2008. Basic information that I know how to get access to: gtAMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4600+ 2.41 GHz gt4GB RAM gt64-Bit Windows 7 Home Premium gtATI Radeon HD 4800 Series video card gt1TB Hard-Drive EDIT: I did a quick google for a system specs application 
So I've had the infamous bug of crashing when I hit Play from the launcher on PC. I've done all the typical fixes that people suggest: turning Godrays off, switching to different combinations of windowed/borderless, setting graphics to low, updating drivers to different types both old and most recent, setting both FO4 and FO4 Launcher to compatibility mode for Windows 7, literally spamming play and hoping that by shotgunning it it'll magically start, verified game cache, uninstalled and reinstal. Just bought a new prebuilt PC online to replace my 2008-ish desktop as the primary gaming PC. One of the primary games I played on it was DOTA2, which ran roughly at a rate of 40-50fps, with some dips into 35 or so. With the new one, however, I'm usually between 15-25fps, even though the actual loading goes at lightning speed in comparison to the old pc. The new one has specs as follows: ------------------ System Information ------------------ Time of this report: 7/26/2014, 14:05:25 Machine. I ran the steam system info thing and got all of this. It would really suck if that's why I keep getting the 'X has stopped working' errors. I was able to run regular DS2 fine. I do have Direct X 11 don't even start on that. Processor Information: Vendor: AuthenticAMD CPU Family: 0x10 CPU Model: 0x4 CPU Stepping: 0x2 CPU Type: 0x0 Speed: 3010 Mhz 4 logical processors 4 physical processors HyperThreading: Unsupported FCMOV: Supported. hey there, have almost succesfully upgraded my win7 sp1 to win10, however, it sets my screen resolution to 1024x768 as recommended and does not allow me to increase it any more than 1280x1024 my graphic card is ATI Radeon HD 4800(old one) and does not have a new driver update since 2013, Windows 8 update what should. It stopped running for me on 9/5/13. The launcher works fine, but every time I try to fly a mission of any kind it get's about 2/3 of the way through the loading screen before crashing to the desktop with the "DCS World has stopped working" windows dialogue box. I have reinstalled the game from a fresh download, and I've performed the 3gb trick for x86 windows 7 and restarted. THANKS! This is a copy of one of the crash logs, they are all ACCESS VIOLATIONS of ZweiBlau.dll: # --------------. 
^^Specs ^^at ^^the ^^bottom So my shitty old computer might be dying. I've been playing magic the gathering 2013 with a friend of mine and suddenly my monitor froze and lost signal, that repeated once or twice and I started getting artifacts on screen. I panicked said goodbye and turned off my PC. Afterwards I opened my case, cleaned it up, got rid of all the dust pulled the gpu out of the PCI slot, cleaned that out a bit with compressed air. I have not unscrewed the radiator since I don't. I think, between all the time me and my little brother has played, StarCraft 2 has crashed more than 10 times. This was especially aggravating during the placement matches in which I lost two because of crashes. The last three games I played crashed also, even when I switched the graphics to the lowest setting. Has anybody else run into this problem? How do I get starcraft 2 to stop crashing? Here's my dxdiag thing if it's relevant (it probably is): ------------------ System Information ------. Hello guys! I am having computer issues right now that I thought I had recently fixed but it appears not. So I had been having random restarts and what-not on my computer about four months ago, and thought I got it repaired. I took it to a repair shop and through a slow trial and error, ended up replacing my PSU, mobo, CPU, and memory. Yes, all the major components except the GPU. I got it all installed by THEM for fear of my messing something up (though I have built a few computers prior My specs: Windows 7 Home Premium AMD Phenom II X4 955 3.20 GHZ Processor 4.00 GB ram 2 ATI Radeon HD 4800 Series Graphics cards MSI K9A2 Mother Board 1000W Power Supply While playing Batman: Arkham City I thought that the graphics were not what they should be, so I ran PC Mark 7 benchmark. I then updated my drivers. Ran the benchmark again; same results. I then thought for some reason that my crossfire may not be working so I turned it off and ran the benchmark and the results.
